Repo for project in course User Interface Programming

Proposed code convention for TFD:

* function names: camel case, example getUserData() instead of get_user_data().
* curly braces after function name like this: 
  function {
    function bodyâ€¦
  }
* id/class: written as one word.
* all css-files in one folder, possible subfolders if needed.
* all images in one folder, possible subfolders if needed.
* name files so they are easy to understand what they intend to do.
